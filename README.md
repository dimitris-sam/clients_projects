Project Summary (as of 11/06/2025):

These are some of the projects assigned to me by my current employer, a company specializing in tool sales and repairs:

Makita and Bosch Scripts: Web scraping tools developed to extract product specifications from the official websites of Makita and Bosch.

Facom Script: A PDF annotation tool designed to highlight content and insert clickable web links into technical documents.

Final Attempt Script: An OCR-based solution used to detect part numbers on spare parts diagrams, highlight them, and annotate the PDF with relevant web links.

Note: The last two scripts are in an early prototype stage, in order to protect the intellectual property and development effort involved.
